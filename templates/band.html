      <p class="bandpage-paragraphs"><span class="bandpage-member-header">Bob Marley</span></br>Bob Marley was born on February 6, 1945, in St. Ann Parish, Jamaica. In 1963, Marley and his friends formed the Wailing Wailers. The Wailers' big break came in 1972, when they landed a contract with Island Records. Marley went on to sell more than 20 million records throughout his career, making him the first international superstar to emerge from the so-called Third World. Bob Marley helped introduce reggae music to the world and remains one of the genre's most beloved artists to this day.

      <p class="bandpage-paragraphs"><span class="bandpage-member-header">Damian Marley</span></br>Damian Robert Nesta "Jr. Gong" Marley, born 21 July 1978, is a Jamaican reggae artist. Damian is the youngest son of reggae musician Bob Marley. Damian's nickname Junior Gong is derived from his father's nickname of Tuff Gong. Damian has been performing since the age of 13. Marley has described his music as "dancehall and reggae. I've noticed ... people trying to separate the two of them," he continues. "It's Jamaican culture in general. I don't try to classify or separate." Distant Relatives Fused hip hop and reggae musical elements, Marley and Nas also incorporated samples from African music into the album. The album's lyrical content heavily revolves around themes concerning Africa, from ancestry and poverty, with social commentary of the United States and Africa. The track "Count Your Blessings" reflects on the plight of Africa.
